# Project-Draw-Rectangle

HTML - CSS - JQUERY

Via event mousedown and mouseup, you can draw a rectangle. From a staring point (mousedown) you can choose every direction for drawing the rectangle.

After the rectangle has been drawn, a color palette will open and when you select a color there, the color in the drawn rectangle will be adjusted.
